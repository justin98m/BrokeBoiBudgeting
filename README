The app is a Ledger that keeps a extended history of your expenses. I have a habit of manually writing down all my expenses to keep myself in check. I found it cumbersome to always have to carry my notebook with me and to remember to write it all down. So I thought if I could just budget the way I like to on my phone and then I would do it more often.

The app allows for you create funds which are just categories of what you spend your money on (Bills, Food, Frivolous Spending) One can also log expense which are associated with one of their created funds to subtract money from that fund. I am currently working on the income functionality so one can add money to various funds at once.

This app is a web app I intend to use for myself only. I do not want to go through the effort of making it user accessible for others right now as I'd rather work on other projects. There are some bugs I know about that wouldnt be good for your average user and I can tolerate them.
