Broke Boi Budgeting is name I picked that plays off the idea that if one want to not be broke in actuality one must always be broke with their mentality. Simply meaning no matter how much money you have remember your fiscally responsible habits you had when you were not generating much income and try to keep them.

The app itself if a Ledger that keeps a extended history of your expenses. I have a habit of manually writing down all my expenses to keep myself in check. I found it cumbersome to always have to carry my notebook with me and to remember to write it all down. So I thought if I could just budget the way I like to on my phone and then I would do it more often.

The app allows for you create funds which are just categories of what you spend your money on (Bills, Food, Frivolous Spending) One can also log expense which are associated with one of their created funds to subtract money from that fund. I am currently working on the income functionality so one can add money to various funds at once.

What Works Right Now:
  Fund creation
  Viewing expenses from a specific fund with sorting capabilities
  Expense creation
  Viewing all expenses with the ability to sort them

What Will Work in the Future:
  Deleting/Archiving Funds
  Deleting expenses
  Adding Income that can be shared by the existing funds
  User Accounts
    Implementing Sessions
    Implementing Auth0 Authentication
  Viewing income history

  Technologies used
    -Node.js
    -MySQL
    -Client Side Vanilla JavaScript
    -Nunjucks
    -HTML and CSS
